# C++ in Latinā

## Motivation

I decided that c++ wasn't strange enough, so I've taken the liberty of translating all (most) c++ keywords and operators into their Latin counterparts-- all through the power of the `#define` preprocessor statement. I also put in redundant symbols for the declensions as well.

## Notes

- This is incomplete
- This couldn't be done without the help of Google Translate and the [Online Latin Dictionary](https://www.online-latin-dictionary.com/)
- Most types and type declarations are neuter
- I didn't translate every keyword directly, but instead I translated the spirit/semantic meaning of them
- For the boolean `bool` type, I used the historical etymology of being named after Boole so I used 3rd declension genitive.
- The declensions aren't enforced at compile-time or run-time, so I can either use c++ black magic and check them at runtime, or write my own c++ compiler.
- `dele` doesn't have a plural because the plural imperative is `delete` which would not work
- I don't know how much I'm going to commit to this bit.
- `asm` is tartarus because that's where I feel I am when I have to work with inline assembly.

## Fun facts

- I literally have no formal education in Latin
- I made this between the hours of 11PM and 5AM
- My favorite Latin cover is "Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Classical Latin)" sung by The_miracle_aligner. [Link](https://open.spotify.com/track/74yEFELfHAAoZfNZKsCGfS?si=40ba360a762f4a27)
